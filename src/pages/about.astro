      A senior computer science student at California State University,
      Fullerton, I am passionate about developing and maintaining software
      applications and systems. Of particular interest are high reliability web
      services, data driven applications/tools, automation, and integrating
      artificial intelligence

    <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl">My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
    <p class="p-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-400">
      Throughout my computer science education, I have sought to not only learn
      the course material but to apply the skills and industry relevant
      knowledge to different domains through software projects as well as
      organizing and leading workshops for the largest computer science club on
      campus (including the ACM chapter at CSUF), participating in hackathons,
      programming competitions, and helping others troubleshoot and fix bugs or
      configuration issues whenever possible. Not only do I enjoy programming
      and take pride in creating reliable and efficient software but I am highly
      teachable and willing to communicate both to learn and help others and
      perform a better job and make the best possible end product!
